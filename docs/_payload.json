Specific topics of focus are Internet Bonds, Distributed Validator Technology, and Multi-Operator Validation. The core team includes 35 members spread across +14 countries.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The core team is building the Obol Network, a protocol to foster trust-minimized staking through multi-operator validation. This will enable low-trust access to Ethereum staking yield, which can be used as a core building block in various Web3 products.\u003C/p>\u003Ch2>The Network\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>The network can be best visualized as a work layer that sits directly on top of the base layer consensus. This work layer is designed to provide the base layer with more resiliency and decentralization as it scales. In this chapter of Ethereum, we will move on to the next great scaling challenge, which is stake centralization. Layers like Obol are critical to the long-term viability and resiliency of public networks, especially networks like Ethereum.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Obol as a layer is focused on scaling main chain staking by providing permissionless access to Distributed Validators. The network utilizes a middleware implementation of Distributed Validator Technology (DVT), to enable the operation of distributed validator clusters that can preserve validators’ current client and remote signing configurations.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>Similar to how roll-up technology laid the foundation for L2 scaling implementations, we believe DVT will do the same for scaling the consensus layer while preserving decentralization. Staking infrastructure is entering its protocol phase of evolution, which must include trust-minimized staking networks that can be plugged into at scale. We believe DVT will evolve into a widely used primitive and will ensure the security, resiliency, and decentralization of public networks.\u003C/p>\u003Cp>The Obol Network develops and maintains three core public goods that will eventually work together through circular economics:\u003C/p>\u003Cul>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>The DV Launchpad\u003C/strong>, a User Interface for bootstrapping and managing Distributed Validators\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Charon\u003C/strong>, a Golang based middleware client that enables validators to run in a fault-tolerant, distributed manner.\u003C/li>\u003Cli>\u003Cstrong>Obol Splits\u003C/strong>, a set of solidity contracts for the formation of Distributed Validators tailored to different use cases such as DeFi, Liquid Staking, and Fractionalized Deposits\u003C/li>\u003C/ul>\u003Ch2>Sustainable Public Goods\u003C/h2>\u003Cp>Obol is inspired by previous work on Ethereum public goods and experimenting with circular economics.
